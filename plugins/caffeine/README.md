# caffeine

**TL;DR:** a home for behaviours that keep agents from falling asleep on work
they started. Two so far: the agent is reminded of every shell it left in the
background, and a foreground subagent is held from ending its turn while a
command the engine would kill with it is still running.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add zienag/alfreds-plugins
```

```bash
claude plugin install caffeine@alfreds-plugins
```

## Reminders of background shells

A Bash call that runs past its timeout is moved to the background, and the
agent reads "You will be notified when it completes." That sounds like someone
else is watching. Nobody is: a hung process sends no completion, so the agent
re-runs the check another way and forgets the first one, which holds its lock
or its repository for hours.

This mod keeps the task in front of the agent. The tool result that moved the
shell to the background already says the task is the agent's and nobody else
watches it. Then, at 5, 10, 30, 60 and 120 minutes of run time and every two
hours after, a reminder names the task and its command, how long it has run,
when its output last changed and the output's last lines, and asks whether it
is still needed, with `TaskStop <id>` as the way out. A task still printing is
probably fine; one silent for forty minutes has probably hung, and the agent
can tell the two apart from the reminder alone.

A reminder reaches a running turn as a row the model reads at its next step,
so a session waiting on a long command gets it when that command returns. An
idle session is woken with the reminder as a prompt, and a toast says so.

A shell a subagent backgrounded is reminded in the subagent's loop. A
background subagent that ends its turn with its shell running is woken by the
engine when the shell finishes, so the main conversation is not told anything
then; if the subagent is gone when a reminder is due, the reminder goes to the
main conversation, naming the subagent. A shell the engine ends with the
subagent is dropped when the subagent ends.

Tracking ends with the task's completion notification or a `TaskStop` of it.

## The subagent hold

A subagent started in the foreground has its shells killed the moment it ends
its turn, and the one who called it gets only "waiting". A subagent started in
the background is woken by the engine when its shell finishes, reads the
output and answers, so it needs no hold.

When a foreground subagent is about to end its turn, the mod looks at the
commands it started that the engine ends with its final response (the tool
result carries `backgroundEndsWithFinalResponse`) and whose output does not yet
end with the engine's exit line. If there are any, the end is blocked once for
them, with a reason that lists the commands, says they will be killed when the
turn ends, and asks the subagent to wait for them in the foreground and then
finish its report. A command that is really a dev server cannot outlive the
subagent: it is to be named in the report, after which the turn may end.

Where an organization manages Claude Code, the engine passes over the hook
of a plugin a person installs; the hold then needs the organization to list
caffeine in its managed settings.

## Reminder options

- `marks`: when the reminders come, in minutes since the command started,
  e.g. `2 5 10 30 60 120`. A mark already past when the shell goes to the
  background is the note in that tool result.
- `every`: how often the reminders go on after the last mark, in minutes.

Run `claude plugin configure caffeine@alfreds-plugins`.

## Working on it

`claude --plugin-dir plugins/caffeine` loads the folder,
`claude plugin test plugins/caffeine` runs the tests, and
[docs/caffeine.md](../../docs/caffeine.md) holds the engine facts
the design rests on.
